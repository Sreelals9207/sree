## Project Description

Welcome to my first foray into the world of linear regression! In this project, I explored a fascinating dataset from Kaggle, which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-and-health-metrics).

This dataset delves into the intriguing relationship between sleep quality and caffeine intake—two topics that impact many of our daily lives. By analyzing this data, I aimed to uncover insights that could help individuals make informed decisions about their sleep habits and caffeine consumption.

After all, who wouldn’t want to sleep better and wake up more refreshed? Join me on this journey as we discover how a little data can lead to big changes in our well-being!

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-and-health-metrics). It consists of 9 features, with the primary focus on the dependent variable: **sleep quality**.

### Libraries Used
To handle and analyze the data, I utilized several key libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, allowing for easy handling of datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, providing tools to create graphs and plots.
- **Seaborn**: To enhance visualizations with attractive statistical graphics.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A powerful library for machine learning, which I used for modeling and evaluating the regression.

### Data Overview
During data exploration, I discovered a significant relationship between sleep quality and caffeine intake. This exploration led me to spend additional time investigating this connection, ultimately revealing a negative correlation between the two variables. 

Importantly, my dataset contained no null values, ensuring the integrity of the analysis.
