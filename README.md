## Project Description

Welcome to my first foray into the world of linear regression! In this project, I explored a fascinating dataset from Kaggle, which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-and-health-metrics).

This dataset delves into the intriguing relationship between sleep quality and caffeine intake—two topics that impact many of our daily lives. By analyzing this data, I aimed to uncover insights that could help individuals make informed decisions about their sleep habits and caffeine consumption.

After all, who wouldn’t want to sleep better and wake up more refreshed? Join me on this journey as we discover how a little data can lead to big changes in our well-being!
